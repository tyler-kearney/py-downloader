# py-downloader
A file downloader implemented with Python and Selenium

For the project to work, you will need to install a web engine. The one I am testing with is the Chrome Web Engine
Currently the path is pointed to a file on my device, you would need to change the path to where you download the file. 
I do eventually plan to add a way to select the path yourself for the web driver. 

The Gecko Web Engine (Based on Firefox) support is planned, but not implemented yet.
